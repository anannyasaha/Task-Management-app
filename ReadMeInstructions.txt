When starting app, you will see a top tab bar of reminders and events.
	-Reminders: (implemented) are for things you will do within the day shortly and only need a text prompt
		-to use reminders, write something in the textfield and then set a time type (seconds, mins, hour) and then
		 a time value and wait for the time to count down and your notification to appear. After is appears, click on it
		 and you will see a text box come up acknowledging you have clicked/dismissed the notification. Click anywhere else
                 on the screen to continue past the textbox
	-Events: (not yet finished) will be for things that you intend to plan for past the current day. Will include details such
		 as time, location, links, text details...

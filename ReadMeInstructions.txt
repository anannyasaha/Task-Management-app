		-to use reminders, write something in the textfield and then set a time type (seconds, mins, hour) and then
		 a time value and wait for the time to count down and your notification to appear. After is appears, click on it
		 and you will see a text box come up acknowledging you have clicked/dismissed the notification. Click anywhere else
                 on the screen to continue past the textbox
		 
When using Reminders/notification, I intended for I intended for it to be basically be used as a "napping program" because I my self use my Iphone notifications for timing my naps. So the way notifications work is that it allows you to set a reminder for your self with the intention of doing that reminder task within the day. The Hour, minute, and seconds are able to be set accordinly and you will recieve a notification upon time running out. The notification is a overhead/top notification, and clicking anywhere on the screen will dimiss it, in which you will then recieve a middle/center notification acknowledging that you have seen the notification, click any where on the screen to dismiss that. 

For Location/maps, click on the Location button on the bottom right and it will show you a map, (some times if nothing loads, you need to press the + button to bring ou to your current location). Presseing the + button brings you to your current location, and the + and - magnifiying glass buttons zoom your view in and out.
